        <img src="Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 6.31.17 AM 2.png" alt="Box model enxample">
        <div><mark>Content</mark>: The actual content inside the box, such as text, images, or other nested elements.</div>
        <div><mark>Padding</mark>: The white space surrounding content. Padding can be set to different sizes to control the distance between the content and the border.</div>
        <div><mark>Border</mark>: A line surrounding content and padding. Borders can be set to different styles, widths and colors.</div>
        <div><mark>Margin</mark>: The white space surrounding the border. Margins are used to control the distance between the box and other elements.</div>
        <p>The <strong>box-sizing</strong> attribute is used to define how the box model of an element is calculated. It has two main values:</p>

        <div><em>content-box (default)</em> The element's width and height include only the content area, excluding padding, borders, and margins.</div>

        <h3>The "clearfix hack" is a technique applied to CSS to solve problems caused by floating elements.</h3>
        <img src="Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 7.13.21 AM 2.png" alt="Clearfix Example 1">
        <div><strong>how to apply clearfix:</strong></div>
        <div>Apply clearfix on the <strong>parent container</strong> to ensure it contains floated child elements correctly.</div>
        <div>Usually, we apply clearfix to containers containing floating elements, such as <em>lists</em>, <em>navigation bars</em>, <em>grids</em>, etc.</div>

        <div><h2 id="c">What is a "margin collapse" and what are the use cases for margin: auto and negative margin values?</h2></div>
        <div><storng>"Margin collapse"</storng> occurs when vertically adjacent margins of block-level elements overlap and share a common margin space.</div>
        <img src="Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 8.15.25 AM 2.png" alt="margin collapse example">
        <h4>Here are some key points about margin collapse:</h4>
        <div><strong>Adjacent sibling elements:</strong></div>
        <div>When there is no content, padding, or borders between adjacent sibling elements, their margins collapse. The collapsed margin is equal to the larger of the two margins, or if they are equal, only one margin remains.</div>
        <div><strong>The purpose of margin:</strong></div>
        <strong>Uses of negative margin values:</strong>
        <div><em>Element overlap:</em> Negative margins can be used to create a visual overlap effect between adjacent elements. For example, you can use negative margins to create image collages or overlapping text effects.</div>
        <div><em>Remove default spacing:</em> Sometimes browsers apply default margins or padding to certain elements, such as<mark> tags </mark>. Negative margins can be used to remove or adjust this default spacing.</div>

        <h2 id="d">What was the problem with achieving Holy Grail layout?</h2>
        <h3>The Holy Grail layout is a web design goal that involves creating a webpage with a header, footer, and three columns in between. The center column should be flexible and adjust to the available space, while the side columns have fixed widths. Achieving this layout was challenging in the past due to limitations in web design techniques and technologies. Problems included column ordering, equal height columns, responsive behavior, and browser compatibility. However, advancements in CSS and browser support have made it easier to achieve the Holy Grail layout today.</h3>
        <img src="Screen Shot 2024-05-09 at 8.42.16 AM 3.png" alt="holy grail layout example">
        <div><strong>Flexbox:</strong> Flexbox has become a popular solution. It allows flexible arrangement on one axis (horizontally or vertically), making it easier to create the Holy Grail layout.</div>
        <div><strong>CSS Grid Layout:</strong> CSS Grid is another approach. It is specially designed for creating complex layouts and full-page layouts like the Holy Grail.</div>

        <h2 id="e">What are the modern ways to achieve Holy Grail layout?</h2>
        <div><h3>The Holy Grail layout is a common web design pattern that consists of a header, main content area, fixed-width sidebars on the left and right, and a footer.</h3></div>
        <div><mark>Flexbox:</mark> Flexbox is also a modern layout technology for aligning elements on a one-dimensional axis. While not the best for a Holy Grail layout, it can be used with some workarounds.</div>
        <div><mark>Avoid using fixed height:</mark> Make sure the center column does not use a fixed height to avoid overflowing content.</div>
